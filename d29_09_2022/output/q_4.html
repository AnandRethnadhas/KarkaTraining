4. The Pluralizer
● Write a function named pluralize that:
○ takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
○ returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".
● Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make
sure it works.
● Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and "geese".
